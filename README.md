「x49」 is a Jekyll Theme from [Jason](https://jsntn.com/about.html).

**Why is 「x49」?**

「x49」 comes from a pleasant coffee shop in Bangkok, which is "[Casa Lapin X49](https://jsntn.com/others/2015/06/03/cs-x49.html)". I've been there many times while I lived there during 2015-2016.

**Note:**

「x49」 is integrated with [jekyll-compress-html](https://github.com/penibelst/jekyll-compress-html) - A Jekyll layout that compresses HTML in pure Liquid. Thanks for Anatol's great work!
